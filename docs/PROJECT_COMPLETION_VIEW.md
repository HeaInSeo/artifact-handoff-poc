# PROJECT_COMPLETION_VIEW

## Purpose

This document provides a one-page overview of what is already complete in `artifact-handoff-poc`, which documented sprints are still open, and which larger backlog items remain afterward.

It does not replace the progress board ([SPRINT_PROGRESS.md](/opt/go/src/github.com/HeaInSeo/artifact-handoff-poc/docs/SPRINT_PROGRESS.md)).
Instead, it exists to answer these questions quickly:

- what is already complete
- which sprints still remain in the currently documented roadmap
- which backlog items would still remain if the project expands further
- how the word “complete” should be interpreted for this repository

## What Is Already Complete

The major completed areas so far are:

1. Sprint 1 baseline / README / research / results tightening
2. failure semantics / failure evidence / bilingual documentation tightening
3. live validation of two catalog-local metadata edge-case families
4. validation of the replica-ready state
5. direct evidence of the producer-only bias
6. the minimum implementation cut that connects `replicaNodes` to the remote candidate set

In other words, the repository already has substantial fixed evidence for:

- same-node reuse
- cross-node peer fetch
- failure-path recording
- edge-case truth
- replica-ready state
- producer-only bias evidence

## Remaining Sprints In The Current Documented Roadmap

According to the current progress board, the directly remaining sprints are:

### H3 - Replica Ordering Semantics Note

Goal:

- fix whether producer-first ordering should remain current implementation truth or become the next policy candidate

Completion criteria:

- the current judgment on ordering semantics is fixed in one document

### I1 - Post-H3 Backlog Reset

Goal:

- narrow the remaining implementation backlog again after the observability and ordering-semantics notes

Completion criteria:

- the next implementation question is fixed in one document

### I2 - Post-H3 Completion View Refresh

Goal:

- realign the completion view and progress board after `H2` and `H3`

Completion criteria:

- the completion document and progress board point to the same remaining question set

## Progress Percentage For The Current Roadmap

The currently documented roadmap should be read like this:

- complete: `59/60`
- about `98%`

Important:

- this is the percentage for the **currently documented sprint roadmap**
- it is not the same thing as overall product completeness or production readiness

## Follow-Up Backlog Beyond The Current Roadmap

The following items are not immediate sprints in the current roadmap, but they remain as larger follow-up backlog if the project expands further:

### 1. Refining the replica-aware fetch policy

- producer-first vs replica-fallback ordering
- selection among multiple replicas
- clearer policy semantics

### 2. Catalog top-level failure reflection

- currently still deferred
- may need re-evaluation if cluster-wide failure visibility becomes necessary

### 3. Retry / recovery policy

- peer fetch retry
- timeout/backoff
- recovery semantics

### 4. Orphan/local-leftover follow-up policy

- cleanup/GC
- retention window
- acceptable catalog-local divergence window

### 5. Scheduler/controller integration evaluation

- whether the project should move beyond script-assisted validation into a more automated placement/control layer

### 6. Optional storage-option follow-up comparison

- `hostPath`
- `local PersistentVolume`

## How “Complete” Should Be Read

This repository is not a typical single-application project that becomes “done” in one step.

Completion is better read in layers:

### A. Sprint 1 validation complete

- baseline
- same-node / cross-node handoff
- failure-path evidence
- edge-case truth

This layer is largely closed.

### B. First replica-aware fetch cycle complete

- replica-ready state
- producer-only bias evidence
- minimal source-selection cut
- replica fallback after producer failure
- post-replica-aware gap review
- post-replica-aware backlog ordering
- post-replica-aware completion-view refresh
- replica-aware observability follow-up

This layer can now be treated as closed once.

### C. Follow-up policy / control-layer expansion complete

- retry/recovery
- cleanup/GC
- scheduler/controller

This layer is still closer to future backlog than to current completion.

## One-Line Summary

`artifact-handoff-poc` is already well through Sprint 1 validation, the first replica-aware implementation/validation cycle, and the immediate post-cycle review/ordering/refresh/observability pass. The next directly remaining core sprint is `H3 - Replica Ordering Semantics Note`.
